**Setup:**

This repo is itself an instance of the same monorepo structure generated by Create TypeScript Project, so the requirements are the same: `node >=12.0` and `yarn >=1.12, <2.0`

```bash
# Fork the repo and clone the fork.
git clone https://github.com/[MY_GITHUB_NAME]/create-ts-project.git
cd create-ts-project
yarn
```

To run commands in local development:

```bash
# Build and run create-ts-project (ctsp)
# Create the project outside of this repo root to avoid issues.
yarn ctsp:dev ~/dev/scratch/my-proj

# Build and run ts-project-scripts (tsp)
yarn tsp:dev --help
```

To run tests: (_There aren't any yet!_)

```bash
# Run create-ts-project tests
yarn ctsp:test

# Run ts-project-scripts tests
yarn tsp:test

# Run ts-project-cli-utils tests
